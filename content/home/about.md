Our research group at [Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn) is focusing on **emergent physics** such as criticality, topology, and fractionalization, etc., in **quantum manybody systems**. Strong interactions among atomic particles can lead to  materials, such as some high-temperature superconductors, with unusual electronic and magnetic properties. To explore these novel states of matter and their potential applications, we aim to develop simulation techniques, e.g., **tensor networks**, **renormalization group** and **deep learning techniques**, that provide reliable and accurate numerical access to thermal and dynamical properties of correlated quantum matter and materials.
