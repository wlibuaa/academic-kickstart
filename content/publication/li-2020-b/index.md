abstract: "With recently developed exponential tensor-network approach, the authors perform accurate finite-temperature simulations of the extended Kitaev model with additional interactions common in Kitaev materials. At intermediate temperature, they find an emergent Curie law of magnetic susceptibility and a stripy spin-structure factor characterizing the robust Kitaev fractional liquid."
