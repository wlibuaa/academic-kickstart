abstract: "Frustrated magnets host the promises of material realizations of new paradigm of quantum matter. However, due to their strongly correlated nature, direct comparison of unbiased model calculations with experiment results is still a challenge to the entire community. Here, we design and implement a protocol of employing quantum many-body computation methodologies -- quantum Monte Carlo and thermal tensor network methods -- to provide model exact calculation of both equilibrium and dynamical properties of a frustrated rare-earth magnet TmMgGaO$_4$ (TMGO) that perfectly explains the corresponding experimental findings. Our results confirm TMGO as an ideal realization of the transverse-field triangular lattice Ising model, and there emerge in its dynamical spectrum ghost images of the vanished magnetic stripe order, i.e., rotonlike excitation modes, representing the vortex-antivortex pair excitations. We propose that the TMGO material realizes at finite temperature a Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) phase resembling that in a superfluid helium film, and further suggest experimental detections of KT physics using solid-state measurements in the quantum magnet."
