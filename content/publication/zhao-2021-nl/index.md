abstract: "Heavy Fermion (HF) states emerge in correlated quantum materials due to the intriguing interplay between localized magnetic moments and itinerant electrons but rarely appear in 3d-electron systems due to high itinerancy of d-electrons. Here, an anomalous enhancement of Kondo screening is observed at the Kondo hole of local Fe vacancies in Fe3GeTe2 which is a recently discovered 3d-HF system featuring Kondo lattice and two-dimensional itinerant ferromagnetism. An itinerant Kondoâ€“Ising model is established to reproduce the experimental results and provides insight into the competition between Ising ferromagnetism and Kondo screening. Our work explains the microscopic origin of the d-electron HF states in Fe3GeTe2 and inspires future studies of the enriched quantum many-body effects with Kondo holes."
